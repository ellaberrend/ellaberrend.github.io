    <p>Walt Disney Animation Studios (WDAS),[6] sometimes shortened to Disney Animation, is an American animation studio that creates animated features and short films for The Walt Disney Company. The studio's current production logo features a scene from its first synchronized sound cartoon, Steamboat Willie (1928). Founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney,[1] it is the oldest-running animation studio in the world. It is currently organized as a division of Walt Disney Studios and is headquartered at the Roy E. Disney Animation Building at the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California.[7] Since its foundation, the studio has produced 61 feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) to Strange World (2022),[8] and hundreds of short films.</p>
    <p>Frozen (2013), Zootopia (2016) and Frozen II (2019) are all among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time. Frozen II became the second highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also had the highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time for an animated film.
    <p>By 2013, the studio was no longer developing hand-drawn animated features and had laid off most of their hand-drawn animation division.[14][15] However, the studio stated that they would be open to proposals from filmmakers for future hand-drawn feature projects.[16]</p>

    <h2 id="History"><p>History</p></h2>
    
    <p><h3>1923–1929: Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio</h3>
        <p>Kansas City, Missouri, natives Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney founded Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in Los Angeles in 1923 and got their start producing a series of silent Alice Comedies short films featuring a live-action child actress in an animated world.[18] The Alice Comedies were distributed by Margaret J. Winkler's Winkler Pictures, which later also distributed a second Disney short subject series, the all-animated Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, through Universal Pictures starting in 1927.[18][19] Upon relocating to California, the Disney brothers initially started working in their uncle Robert Disney's garage at 4406 Kingswell Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, then, in October 1923, formally launched their studio in a small office on the rear side of a real estate agency's office at 4651 Kingswell Avenue. In February 1924, the studio moved next door to office space of its own at 4649 Kingswell Avenue. In 1925, Disney put down a deposit on a new location at 2719 Hyperion Avenue in the nearby Silver Lake neighborhood, which came to be known as the Hyperion Studio to distinguish it from the studio's other locations, and, in January 1926, the studio moved there and took on the name Walt Disney Studio.[20]</p>
    <p><h3>1929–1940: Reincorporation, Silly Symphonies, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</h3></p>
<p>In 1929, disputes over finances between Disney and Powers led to Disney's studio, reincorporated on December 16, 1929, as Walt Disney Productions, signing a new distribution contract with Columbia Pictures.[27][28][29] Powers, in return, signed away Ub Iwerks, who began producing cartoons at his own studio, although he would return to Disney in 1940.[30]</p>
<p>Columbia distributed Disney's shorts for two years before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new 3-strip color film process,[31] which allowed for fuller-color reproduction where previous color film processors could not.[32] The result was the Silly Symphony cartoon Flowers and Trees, the first film commercially released in full Technicolor.[32][33] Flowers and Trees was a major success[32][34] and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in Technicolor.[35][36]</p>

<p><h3>1948–1966: Return of features, Buena Vista, end of shorts, layoffs, and Walt's final years</h3></p>
<p>In 1948, Disney returned to the production of full-length features with Cinderella, a feature film based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. At a cost of nearly $3 million, the future of the studio depended upon the success of this film.[73] Upon its release in 1950, Cinderella proved to be a box-office success, with the profits from the film's release allowing Disney to carry on producing animated features throughout the 1950s.[74] Following its success, production on the in-limbo features Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and Lady and the Tramp was resumed. In addition, an ambitious new project, an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale "Sleeping Beauty" set to Tchaikovsky's classic score, was begun but took much of the rest of the decade to complete.[75]</p>
<p>Alice in Wonderland, released in 1951, met with a lukewarm response at the box office and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release.[76] Peter Pan, released in 1953, on the other hand, was a commercial success and the sixth highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office success than any other Disney animated feature since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,[77] earning an estimated $6.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955.[78] Lady and the Tramp is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process,[77] and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.[79]</p>

<p><h3>1966–1984: Decline in popularity, Don Bluth's entrance and departure, "rock bottom"</h3></p>
<p>Following Walt Disney's death, Wolfgang Reitherman continued as both producer and director of the features.[96][97] The studio began the 1970s with the release of The Aristocats, the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney.[97] In 1971, Roy O. Disney, the studio co-founder, died and Walt Disney Productions was left in the hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker, who alternated as chairman and CEO in overlapping terms until 1978.[98] The next feature, Robin Hood (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features.[96] Both The Aristocats and Robin Hood were minor box office and critical successes.[96][97]</p>
<p>The Rescuers, released in 1977, was a success exceeding the achievements of the previous two Disney features.[97] Receiving positive reviews, high commercial returns, and an Academy Award nomination, it ended up being the third highest-grossing film of the year and the most successful and best reviewed Disney animated film since The Jungle Book.[96][97] The film was reissued in 1983, accompanied by a new Disney featurette, Mickey's Christmas Carol.[99]</p>

<p><h3>1984–1989: Michael Eisner takeover, restructuring, and return to prominence</h3></p>
<p>After a series of corporate takeover attempts in 1984, Roy E. Disney, son of Roy O. and nephew of Walt, resigned from the company's board of directors and launched a campaign called "SaveDisney," successfully convincing the board to fire Miller. Roy E. Disney brought in Michael Eisner as Disney's new CEO and Frank Wells as president.[98][111] Eisner in turn named Jeffrey Katzenberg chairman of the film division, The Walt Disney Studios.[100] Near completion when the Eisner regime took over Disney, The Black Cauldron (1985) came to represent what would later be referred to as the "rock bottom" point for Disney animation.[100] The studio's most expensive feature to that point at $44 million, The Black Cauldron was a critical and commercial failure.[100] The film's $21 million box office gross led to a loss for the studio, putting the future of the animation division in jeopardy.[100]</p>

<p><h3>1994–1999: End of the Disney Renaissance, declining returns</h3></p>
<p>Concerns arose internally at the Disney studio, particularly from Roy E. Disney, about studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg taking too much credit for the success of Disney's early 1990s releases.[100] Disney Company president Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter accident in 1994, and Katzenberg lobbied CEO Michael Eisner for the vacant president position. Instead, tensions between Katzenberg, Eisner and Disney resulted in Katzenberg being forced to resign from the company on August 24 of that year,[147] with Joe Roth taking his place.[147] On October 12, 1994, Katzenberg went on to become one of the founders of DreamWorks SKG, whose animation division became Disney's key rival in feature animation,[129][148] with both computer animated films such as Antz (1998) and traditionally-animated films such as The Prince of Egypt (1998).[146] In December 1994, the Animation Building in Burbank was completed for the animation division.</p>

<p><h3>1999–2005: Slump, downsizing, and conversion to computer animation, corporate issues</h3></p>
<p>Fantasia 2000, a sequel to the 1940 film that had been a pet project of Roy E. Disney's since 1990,[160][161] premiered on December 17, 1999, at Carnegie Hall in New York City as part of a concert tour that also visited London, Paris, Tokyo and Pasadena, California. The film was then released in 75 IMAX theaters worldwide from January 1 to April 30, 2000, making it the first animated feature-length film to be released in the format; a standard theatrical release followed on June 15, 2000. Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions,[160] Fantasia 2000 was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format.[162] The film's $90 million worldwide box office total against its $90 million production cost[161] resulted in it losing $100 million for the studio.[161][163] Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1999 to become president of The Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth.[164] Thomas Schumacher, who had been Schneider's vice president of animation for several years, became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation.[164] By this time, competition from other studios had driven animators' incomes to all-time highs,[129] making traditionally-animated features even more costly to produce.[148] Schumacher was tasked with cutting costs, and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio's staff – which peaked at 2,200 people in 1999 – down to approximately 1,200 employees.[165][166]</p>

<p><h3>2005–2010: Rebound, Disney's acquisition of Pixar and renaming</h3></p>
<p>Iger later said, "I didn't yet have a complete sense of just how broken Disney Animation was." He described its history since the early 1990s as "dotted by a slew of expensive failures" like Hercules and Chicken Little; the "modest successes" like Mulan and Lilo & Stitch were still critically and commercially unsuccessful compared to the earlier films of the Disney Renaissance.[197] After Iger became CEO, Jobs resumed negotiations for Pixar with Disney.[200] On January 24, 2006, Disney announced that it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock deal,[201] with the deal closing that May,[200][202][203] and the Circle 7 studio launched to produce Toy Story 3 was shut down,[204][205] with most of its employees returning to Feature Animation and Toy Story 3 returning to Pixar's control.[206] Iger later said that it was "a deal I wanted badly, and [Disney] needed badly". He believed that Disney Animation needed new leadership[197] and, as part of the acquisition, Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter were named president and Chief Creative Officer, respectively, of Feature Animation as well as Pixar.[202]Iger later said, "I didn't yet have a complete sense of just how broken Disney Animation was."

<p>WALL-E (stylized with an interpunct as WALL·E) is a 2008 American computer-animated science fiction film[5] produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The movie was a success in 2018 and featured a  <a href="https://github.com/maes4595/maes4595.github.io/wa3">post-apocalyptic world</a></h3> with enjoyable robots and such. It was directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, produced by Jim Morris, and co-written by Jim Reardon.</p>

<p><h3>2019–present: Continued success and expansion to television</h3></p>
<p>In August 2019, it was announced that Andrew Millstein would be stepping down from his role as president, before moving on to become co-president of Blue Sky Studios alongside Robert Baird, while Clark Spencer was named president of Disney Animation, reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Bergman and working alongside chief creative officer Jennifer Lee.[3][4]</p>

<h2 id="Production Logo"><p>Production Logo</p></h2>
<p>Until 2007, Walt Disney Animation Studios did not use a traditional production logo, using the standard Walt Disney Pictures logo instead. Starting in 2007, an on-screen production logo based on Steamboat Willie was added after the 2006 Disney logo. It depicts Mickey Mouse, in his classic form, being drawn in against a beige paper background. As pages flip in the manner of a flip book, the drawing is animated into a scene from the aforementioned short in which Mickey is whistling. The camera zooms out onto a yellow-gold spotlight background and the wordmark of Walt Disney Animation Studios is displayed below the scene.</p>

<p><h3>Management</h3></p>
<p>Walt Disney Animation Studios is currently managed by Jennifer Lee (Chief Creative Officer, 2018–present) and Clark Spencer (President, 2019–present). Former presidents of the studio include Andrew Millstein (November 2014–July 2019),[3][276] Edwin Catmull (June 2007–July 2019), David Stainton (January 2003–January 2006), Thomas Schumacher (January 1999–December 2002) and Peter Schneider (1985–January 1999).[325] Other Disney executives who also exercised much influence within the studio were John Lasseter (2006–2018, Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney Animation Studios), Roy E. Disney (1972–2009, CEO and Chairman, Walt Disney Animation Studios), Jeffrey Katzenberg (1984–94, Chairman, The Walt Disney Studios), Michael Eisner (1984–2005, CEO, The Walt Disney Company), and Frank Wells (1984–94, President and COO, The Walt Disney Company). Following Roy Disney's death in 2009, the WDAS headquarters in Burbank was re-dedicated as The Roy E. Disney Animation Building in May 2010.[326]</p>
<p><h3>Location</h3></p>
<p>Since 1995, Walt Disney Animation Studios has been headquartered in the Roy E. Disney Animation Building in Burbank, California, across Riverside Drive from The Walt Disney Studios, where the original Animation building (now housing corporate offices) is located. The Disney Animation Building's lobby is capped by a large version of the famous hat from the Sorcerer's Apprentice segment of Fantasia (1940), and the building is informally called the "hat building" for that reason.[327] Disney Animation shares its site with ABC Studios, whose building is located immediately to the west.</p>

    <p><h3>Feature Films</h3></p>
    <p>Walt Disney Animation Studios has produced animated features in a series of animation techniques, including traditional animation, computer animation, combination of both and animation combined with live-action scenes. The studio's first film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, was released on December 21, 1937,[335] and their most recent film, Strange World, was released on November 23, 2022. From the Disney Renaissance to the post-Renaissance era, their films have cost between $40–140 million. Starting with Chicken Little (2005), most of their films have cost $150–175 million. Tangled (2010) is the studio's most expensive film, with a budget of $260 million.</p>
    <p><h3>Short Films</h3></p>
    <p>Since Alice Comedies in the 1920s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has produced a series of prominent short films, including the Mickey Mouse cartoons and the Silly Symphonies series, until the cartoon studio division was closed in 1956. Many of these shorts provided a medium for the studio to experiment with new technologies that they would use in their filmmaking process, such as the synchronization of sound in Steamboat Willie (1928),[23] the integration of the three-strip Technicolor process in Flowers and Trees (1932),[32] the multiplane camera in The Old Mill (1937),[44] the xerography process in Goliath II (1960),[336] and the hand-drawn/CGI hybrid animation in Off His Rockers (1992),[337] Paperman (2012),[244] and Get a Horse! (2013).[250]</p>
