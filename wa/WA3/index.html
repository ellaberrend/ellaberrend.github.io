    <p>Walt Disney Animation Studios (WDAS),[6] sometimes shortened to Disney Animation, is an American animation studio that creates animated features and short films for The Walt Disney Company. The studio's current production logo features a scene from its first synchronized sound cartoon, Steamboat Willie (1928). Founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney,[1] it is the oldest-running animation studio in the world. It is currently organized as a division of Walt Disney Studios and is headquartered at the Roy E. Disney Animation Building at the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California.[7] Since its foundation, the studio has produced 61 feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) to Strange World (2022),[8] and hundreds of short films.</p>
    <p>Frozen (2013), Zootopia (2016) and Frozen II (2019) are all among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time. Frozen II became the second highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also had the highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time for an animated film.
    <p>By 2013, the studio was no longer developing hand-drawn animated features and had laid off most of their hand-drawn animation division.[14][15] However, the studio stated that they would be open to proposals from filmmakers for future hand-drawn feature projects.[16]</p>

    <p><h3>1923–1929: Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio</h3>
        <p>Kansas City, Missouri, natives Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney founded Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in Los Angeles in 1923 and got their start producing a series of silent Alice Comedies short films featuring a live-action child actress in an animated world.[18] The Alice Comedies were distributed by Margaret J. Winkler's Winkler Pictures, which later also distributed a second Disney short subject series, the all-animated Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, through Universal Pictures starting in 1927.[18][19] Upon relocating to California, the Disney brothers initially started working in their uncle Robert Disney's garage at 4406 Kingswell Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, then, in October 1923, formally launched their studio in a small office on the rear side of a real estate agency's office at 4651 Kingswell Avenue. In February 1924, the studio moved next door to office space of its own at 4649 Kingswell Avenue. In 1925, Disney put down a deposit on a new location at 2719 Hyperion Avenue in the nearby Silver Lake neighborhood, which came to be known as the Hyperion Studio to distinguish it from the studio's other locations, and, in January 1926, the studio moved there and took on the name Walt Disney Studio.[20]</p>
    <p><h3>1929–1940: Reincorporation, Silly Symphonies, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</h3></p>
<p>In 1929, disputes over finances between Disney and Powers led to Disney's studio, reincorporated on December 16, 1929, as Walt Disney Productions, signing a new distribution contract with Columbia Pictures.[27][28][29] Powers, in return, signed away Ub Iwerks, who began producing cartoons at his own studio, although he would return to Disney in 1940.[30]</p>
<p>Columbia distributed Disney's shorts for two years before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new 3-strip color film process,[31] which allowed for fuller-color reproduction where previous color film processors could not.[32] The result was the Silly Symphony cartoon Flowers and Trees, the first film commercially released in full Technicolor.[32][33] Flowers and Trees was a major success[32][34] and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in Technicolor.[35][36]</p>

<p><h3>1948–1966: Return of features, Buena Vista, end of shorts, layoffs, and Walt's final years</h3></p>
<p>In 1948, Disney returned to the production of full-length features with Cinderella, a feature film based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. At a cost of nearly $3 million, the future of the studio depended upon the success of this film.[73] Upon its release in 1950, Cinderella proved to be a box-office success, with the profits from the film's release allowing Disney to carry on producing animated features throughout the 1950s.[74] Following its success, production on the in-limbo features Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and Lady and the Tramp was resumed. In addition, an ambitious new project, an adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale "Sleeping Beauty" set to Tchaikovsky's classic score, was begun but took much of the rest of the decade to complete.[75]</p>
<p>Alice in Wonderland, released in 1951, met with a lukewarm response at the box office and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release.[76] Peter Pan, released in 1953, on the other hand, was a commercial success and the sixth highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office success than any other Disney animated feature since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,[77] earning an estimated $6.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955.[78] Lady and the Tramp is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process,[77] and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.[79]</p>
