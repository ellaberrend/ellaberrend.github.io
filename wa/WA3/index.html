    <h1> Walt Disney Animation Studios </h1>
    <p>Walt Disney Animation Studios (WDAS),[6] sometimes shortened to Disney Animation, is an American animation studio that creates animated features and short films for The Walt Disney Company. The studio's current production logo features a scene from its first synchronized sound cartoon, Steamboat Willie (1928). Founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney,[1] it is the oldest-running animation studio in the world. It is currently organized as a division of Walt Disney Studios and is headquartered at the Roy E. Disney Animation Building at the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California.[7] Since its foundation, the studio has produced 61 feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) to Strange World (2022),[8] and hundreds of short films.</p>
    <p>Frozen (2013), Zootopia (2016) and Frozen II (2019) are all among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time. Frozen II became the second highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also had the highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time for an animated film.
    <p>By 2013, the studio was no longer developing hand-drawn animated features and had laid off most of their hand-drawn animation division.[14][15] However, the studio stated that they would be open to proposals from filmmakers for future hand-drawn feature projects.[16]</p>
