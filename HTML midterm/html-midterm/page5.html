<h1>Changelog</h1>

<h2>Page 1</h2>
<ul>
   <li>On the first page, I added a link within the navigation bar to reference Page 5. I added it with the same formatting as the other pages.</li>
   <li>I also added the language as english on the top within the title.</li>
   <li>I also added meta within the title for formatting reasons.</li>
   <li>I moved the title within Page 1 as it wasn't in the right order and posed as an error when I checked it.</li>
   <li>On line 81 or 82 (I can't remember) I fixed the <!-- <e> --> as it was not closed. It was also supposed to be 'em' within the brackets.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>On line 25, I added an end tag to the bolded statement around the 'Beehive Inn' Title.</li>
    <li>On line 51, I replaced the order the 'bold' tag and the 'H2' tag, as it wasn't applicable to the heading in the order it originally was.</li>
    <li>On line 55 I changed the reference when it said 'where do i go.' I added the link to segmental arch via the wikipedia page link. </li>
    <li>I also tried to mess with the headers and make them all the same size? Or sizes that made sense? The history one would not change no matter how I messed with it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Page 3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>On line 52, I corrected a typo from 'l' to 'li' within the tag. (So it would be a list instead of a typo)</li>
    <li>On line 81, it did not have 'td' within the closing tag, which affected all of the remaining code until fixed.</li>
    <li>On line 96, I had to indent 'Alexia's' name to follow formatting and then added a start and end tag.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<ul>
    <li>At the top I had to start the document with 'Doctype' as it was missing from the original code.</li>
    <li>I needed to re-link the photos based on how they saved on my GitHub, but I just retyped the reference for the images.</li>
    <li>I also added alternate text to all of the photos, which were just copied by the original image names.</li>
    <li>Within the 'cat' column and the 'dog' column, there were two separate lines that needed corrected start and end tags. I forgot which lines. Oops.</li>
    <li>I edited the order in which the images were separated so that all the dogs were in one column, cats in another, and other in the last one.</li>
    <li>ALSO! For whatever reason, two random photos would not save on my laptop so sometimes it doesn't link correctly because it's in my iCloud? Idk.</li>
</ul>
